He dedicated himself to his studies and ultimately achieved an impressive 96.8% in his exams, topping the district.He also shared his experiences with physical and financial challenges and provided insights on how to address and overcome these issues. His lecture left a significant impact on me, providing valuable knowledge and inspiration._
